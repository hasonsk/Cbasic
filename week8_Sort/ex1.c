   •[] We assume that you make a mobile phone’s address book.
   •[] At least, we want to write a program that can store about 100 structure data with name and phone number 
   and e-mail address.
   •Read about 10 data from an input file to this structure, and write the data that is 
   sorted in ascending order into an output file.
   •[] Use the insertion sort and selection sort
   •[] (1)Write a program that uses array of structure 
   •[](2)  Write a program that uses singly-linked list or doubly-linked list.•In both program, print out 
   the number of comparisons made during the sorting process of each algorithm.
